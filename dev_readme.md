## 🔄 Git Workflow

### For Repository Owners and Forked Users

1. **Sync your local repository before development**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git fetch upstream  # if upstream is configured for the base repo
   git pull origin main
   git pull upstream main
````

2. **Create a new branch for your work**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/module_name
   ```

3. **After completing your work**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py test  # Run tests
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Feature summary"
   git push origin feature/module_name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request**:

   * Use a clear title and description.
   * Link related issues if applicable.
   * Assign reviewers and request feedback.

## 🚀 Development Guidelines

### 1. Before You Code

* Start the server and make sure the project runs:

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
* Check for pending migrations or broken views.

### 2. While Coding

* Follow PEP8 style.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Write docstrings for complex logic.
* Keep components modular and reusable.

### 3. After Coding

* Test thoroughly (manual + `python manage.py test`).
* Update README or inline documentation if needed.
* Push and create a PR.

## 📦 Branch Naming Convention

Use consistent and descriptive branch names:

```
feature/hr-filtering
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/critical-db-fix
refactor/user-model-cleanup
```

---

## 👥 Remote Team Collaboration

### Daily Routine

* ✅ Pull latest changes before starting work.
* ✅ Push WIP at end of day (`[WIP]` in commit or branch name if needed).
* ✅ Communicate blockers in chat or issues.

### Communication

* Use Slack, Discord, or Teams for real-time updates.
* Log decisions or tasks in GitHub Issues or Project Boards.
* Keep discussions in PRs clean and focused on code.

### Code Review Best Practices

* All PRs must be reviewed before merging.
* Use constructive feedback.
* No direct pushes to `main` unless approved by project lead.

### Syncing Across Time Zones

* Use a `dev` or `staging` branch for integration.
* Merge to `main` only after QA or staging approval.

---

## 📋 Testing & Tooling (Optional)

* Lint code with `flake8` or `black`.
* Add unit tests for new features.
* Consider GitHub Actions for CI/CD (planned).
* Optional: Use `.pre-commit` hooks for lint and test enforcement.

---

## 🧠 Environment & Secrets

* Use `.env` files for sensitive data and environment-specific settings.
* Never commit secrets, credentials, or production keys.
